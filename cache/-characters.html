She loves when you give her attention through baths, games, and feeding, but she is no weakling! This bunny has braved the harsh meadows and the daunting task of traveling across many worlds to complete Age of Bunnies. For a time, she was even on the logo for Game 103. The bunny is based on the bunnies that I used to have as pets as seen in the video in Age of Bunnies. She is named after what I wanted to call my little sister before she was born.</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Cloudie"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/cloud.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Cloudie</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[kl&#x325;la&#x361;udi]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/download/cloudworld'>Cloud World</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/flip-a-blox'>Flip-a-Blox</a></div><div class='characters-description'>This cloud is much smaller than the other clouds, but he does not let that bother him. He loves to float around, but he makes it is purpose to avoid hitting objects in the sky in order not to blur their vision. He is a kind cloud. However, that does not stop him from playing games. He thinks that most clouds have quite a boring life, so he tries his best to zip through the skies when he is going somewhere to try and encourage the other clouds to have a little fun.</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Cocoa"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/cocoa.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Cocoa</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[k&#688;oko]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/abeerpg'>A Bee RPG</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/cocoacatch'>Cocoa Catch</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/cocoacatch3'>Cocoa Catch 3</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/download/cocoafetch'>Cocoa Fetch</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/cocoamp3player'>Cocoa MP3 Player</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/download/cocoaracing'>Cocoa Racing</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/cocoarpg'>Cocoa RPG</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/cocoaball'>CocoaBall</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/download/dogland'>Dogland</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/flip-a-blox'>Flip-a-Blox</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/game103rpg'>Game 103 RPG</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/rainincatsdogs'>Rainin' Cats & Dogs</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/thegreatduckdeechase'>The Great Duckdee Chase</a></div><div class='characters-description'>Cocoa is my dog, born on January 2, 2006, and he has had many appearances in Game 103 games over the years. He is a Chocolate Labrador who loves to be around his family wherever they are (he will bark when he is not). He enjoys playing with his ball, but he often likes to play tug of war, along with fetch, as you try to grab the ball out of his mouth while he continuously lets go ever so slightly then grips the ball again. Sometimes, he even drops his ball past his fence, so his family will have to get it for him. He loves to be pet, and he'll run up to you and try to touch your face with his if you're sitting and he's excited (especially if you just arrived). He is always ready to go outside!</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Daxpy"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/daxpy.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Daxpy</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[d&aelig;kspi]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/daxpythedino'>Daxpy the Dino</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/flip-a-blox'>Flip-a-Blox</a></div><div class='characters-description'>Daxpy the dinosaur was around for about a year before he made his first appearance in a game. Often times in class, I would doodle pictures of Daxpy. These pictures were almost identical to Daxpy's current appearance. Because he was so prevalent my classes, his name is actually a term from my parallel computing class. I have always loved dinosaurs, so that may be why Daxpy took his place in my notes. He loves to eat apple-like fruit from palm-like trees, but he is also content eating them off the ground.</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Deedee"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/chickadee.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Deedee</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[didi]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/trampolinechickadee'>Trampoline Chickadee</a></div><div class='characters-description'>This chickadee loves to bounce on trampolines all day long. She is quite good at flips! She has to be careful though, because she is allergic to bees. Though she has the disadvantage of not being able to fly, she has a big heart for the other birds in her flock. She is even willing to brave the bees in order to rescue them. Her name is based on my mother's nickname.</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Dotsalot"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/chipmunk.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Dotsalot</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[d&#596;t&#794;s&#601;l&#596;t&#794;]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/pixelmunk'>Pixelmunk</a></div><div class='characters-description'>This little chipmunk loves acorns and playing in trees. He is somewhat shy, but he enjoys seeing familiar faces. Because he plays so much, he is very agile and fit for a chipmunk. This gives him quite the appetite! He is based off of a little chipmunk that would spend its time in my grandmother's front yard.</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Duckdee"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/duckdee.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Duckdee</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[d&#x28C;k&#x31A;di]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/flip-a-blox'>Flip-a-Blox</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/thegreatduckdeechase'>The Great Duckdee Chase</a></div><div class='characters-description'>This little duck gets lost quite easily!

Sometimes, he tries to strike up a conversation with a dog when he is not hungry, but usually, he is too quiet to be heard. When the dog does hear him, however, he and the dog will often appreciate the talk and consider each other friends despite their differences.</div></div></div><div class='characters-entry'><a name="Giraffie"></a><div class='characters-image-container'><div class='characters-image-size-boundaries'><img class='characters-image' src='/images/characters/giraffe.png'/></div></div><div class='characters-text-container'><div class='characters-name'>Giraffie</div><div class='characters-ipa-name'>[d&#x361;&#x292;&#x25A;&#xE6;fi]</div><div class='characters-appears'>Appears in: <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/clicktheelephant'>Click the Elephant</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/flip-a-blox'>Flip-a-Blox</a>, <a class='characters-game-link' href='/game/game103world'>Game 103 World</a></div><div class='characters-description'>You do not want to click this giraffe!

When someone is unkind to him, he turns the other cheek and merrily goes on his way. He enjoys being around his many brothers and sisters, and he likes to play dodging games with his friend, Mousie. He likes the forest, mountains, and city. He loves bird seed, and when he sees some, he will rush to get it. He is sometimes sad when he doesn't reach the seed in time, but his blue bird friends quickly cheer him up. Then, he is back to his old self.
