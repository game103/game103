				<p>Hi, I'm James Grams, and I run Game 103. I am a Christian. Game 103 was officially started on May 2, 2008. It began as a website that would host interesting games and videos. But today, it has been transformed into a a place for original Game 103 web tools and games along with other family-friendly games.</p>
				<p>Around the time Game 103 was started, I began making downloadable games with a program called Game Maker. I made some simple games that I still have today. From Game Maker, I moved into Adobe Flash. Since then, I have created multiple flash games, and gained a lot of experience in programming actionscript.</p>
				<p>The desire for programming communication interfaces caused me to start learning php. You will see some examples of my work with php on the Web Tools page. </p>
				<p>Learning flash and php along with taking a class allowed me to pick up a good amount of html and css. That's how you're viewing this site today! 
				<p>If you have an idea for a game, online tool, or flash application, shoot me an email and I'll see what I can do. Thanks for visiting, and enjoy the site.</p>
